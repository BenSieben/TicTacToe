TicTacToe by Ben Sieben
May 22, 2012


//INTRODUCTION
This program is the simple game of tic-tac-toe
Whoever gets the dimension number of tiles (ex: a 3x3 game requires 3; 4x4 requires 4) in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagnol) wins
There are two rules:
	1) If a spot is already picked, you cannot pick it
	2) If nobody gets the dimension number of tiles in a row when all tiles are filled, the result is a tie
If you're bored, this program provides simple entertainment
You can play either single player (versus AI) or multiplayer (with another person)


//INSTRUCTIONS

In game, use the mouse's left click to pick whichever empty tile you wish to fill
